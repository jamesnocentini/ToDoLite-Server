# ToDoLite Server

This repository holds the configuration file for Sync Gateway and a small App Server that acts as a reverse proxy to create new users through a public endpoint.

It can be run with a Couchbase Server instance using Docker Compose and deployed to a VM using Tutum.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally you must first install docker on your host and run the following commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jamiltz/ToDoLite-Server.git
$ cd ToDoLite-Server
$ docker-compose up
```

**Note**: You may have to wait for about 20 seconds for all containers to be up.

To signup new users:

```
$ curl -vX POST http://<ip_address>:8000/signup \
			-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
			-d '{"name": "james", "password": "letmein"}'
```

## Deploying to Tutum

Pushing on the master branch of the GitHub repository will automatically trigger a build in Docker Hub and deploy it to Tutum.

It can take a couple minutes for Docker Hub to build a new image. You can see the status [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jamiltz/todolite-server/builds/).

The public IP is `178.62.157.91`. The endpoint to replicate to is `http://178.62.157.91:8000/todos`.

And to signup new users:

```
$ curl -vX POST http://178.62.157.91:8000/signup \
			-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
			-d '{"name": "james", "password": "letmein"}'
```

## Troubleshooting in production

With the Tutum credentials, you can select the `todolite-server` container and access a Terminal to get the list of users with a simple curl command for example (`curl http://localhost:4985/todos/_user/`).
